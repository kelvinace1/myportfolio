    The programming language Python was conceived in the late 1980s,[1] and its implementation was started in December 1989[2] by Guido van Rossumat CWI in the Netherlands as a successor to ABC capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system.[3] Van Rossum is Python's principal author, and his continuing central role in deciding the direction of Python is reflected in the title given to him by the Python community, Benevolent Dictator for Life(BDFL).[4][5] (However, van Rossum stepped down as leader on July 12, 2018.[6]) Python was named for the BBC TV show Monty Python's Flying Circus.

      Python 2.0 was released on October 16, 2000, with many major new features, including a cycle-detecting garbage collector (in addition to reference counting) for memory management and support for Unicode. However, the most important change was to the development process itself, with a shift to a more transparent and community-backed process.[8]

Python 3.0, a major, backwards-incompatible release, was released on December 3, 2008[9] after a long period of testing. Many of its major features have also been backported to the backwards-compatible, while by now unsupported, Python 2.6 and 2.7.

 Python 3.0 (also called "Python 3000" or "Py3K") was released on December 3, 2008.[9] It was designed to rectify fundamental design flaws in the language—the changes required could not be implemented while retaining full backwards compatibility with the 2.x series, which necessitated a new major version number. The guiding principle of Python 3 was: "reduce feature duplication by removing old ways of doing things".

Python 3.0 was developed with the same philosophy as in prior versions. However, as Python had accumulated new and redundant ways to program the same task, Python 3.0 had an emphasis on removing duplicative constructs and modules, in keeping with "There should be one— and preferably only one —obvious way to do it".

                <p class="text5 flow-text">
     Some of the major changes included for Python 3.0 were:

Changing print so that it is a built-in function, not a statement. This made it easier to change a module to use a different print function, as well as making the syntax more regular. In Python 2.6 and 2.7 print() is available as a builtin but is masked by the print statement syntax, which can be disabled by entering from __future__ import print_function at the top of the file[34]

Removal of the Python 2 inputfunction, and the renaming of the raw_input function to input. Python 3's input function behaves like Python 2's raw_inputfunction, in that the input is always returned as a string rather than being evaluated as an expression

Moving reduce (but not map or filter) out of the built-in namespace and into functools(the rationale being code that uses reduce is less readable than code that uses a for loop and accumulator variable)

      In February 1991, Van Rossum published the code (labeled version 0.9.0) to alt.sources.[11] Already present at this stage in development were classes with inheritance, exception handling, functions, and the core datatypes of list, dict, strand so on. Also in this initial release was a module system borrowed from Modula-3; Van Rossum describes the module as "one of Python's major programming units".[1] Python's exception model also resembles Modula-3's, with the addition of an else clause.[3] In 1994 comp.lang.python, the primary discussion forum for Python, was formed, marking a milestone in the growth of Python's userbase.
